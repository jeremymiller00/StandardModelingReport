# Standard Modeling Report

The goal of this repository is to create a standardized format for tracking and presenting the fitting, tuning, and evaluation processes of machine learning models.  

## Priorities:
* Results should be easy to track and update
* Each modeling experiment should be recorded
* Brief problem statement should be provided
* A new tab for each model type
* Excel will be used, results will be persistant and readable by non-data scientists

## What should be included in each report?
* Brief problem statment
* Description of training data
* Link to s3 bucket or other data source
* Link to Databricks notebook or other code source
* Model hyperparameters
* Modeling assumptions
* Training time
* Scores
* Plots: loss function, bias/variance
